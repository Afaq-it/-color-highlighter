# 3.0
This plugin has been reworked from the  ground up, and therefore *tries* to support all languages as much as possible. But currently it fully supports:
- XML
- HTML
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Properties
- YAML
- Python
- Ruby
- Java (ColorUiResource)
- Kotlin (ColorUiResource)
- Scala (ColorUiResource)
- Go
- Objective C
- Swift

More to come!
